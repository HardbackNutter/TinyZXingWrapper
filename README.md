# TinyZXingWrapper
A tiny android wrapper for the ZXing barcode scanner library (https://github.com/zxing/zxing). 

- Uses CameraX.

- Written as a replacement for https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded.
  Not call-compatible, but it should be (it is!) easy to migrate to.

- Minimum API 26 (Android 8.0)
- Compiled against ZXing core 3.5.1
